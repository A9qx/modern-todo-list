## How to Use:

To ensure that the HTML file loads correctly and to facilitate ease of editing, it is imperative to **use a Web Server**, such as the one available in VSCode, as **opposed to simply opening the file in Chrome**, as the latter may result in incorrect loading and cause unnecessary difficulties during the editing process.
